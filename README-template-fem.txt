## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

One of the things I really struggle with on this project was setting up the hero image to live simultaneously within the columns as a grid item, and also go beyond the grid container to achieve the look of the design. I was able to make this work by creating a negative margin property and upping the width to 125%. I imagine there is better ways to achieve the same result, but I was happy with being able to figure it out and learned quite a bit from the challenge it presented. If you have any suggetions on a better method, I would appreciate the insight.

```css
.hero-img {
    z-index: -1;
    margin-top: -200px;
    max-width: 250%;
    max-height: 100%;
    align-self:center;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Crash Course 2022 - Brad Traversy](https://www.example.com) - Brad Traversy's recent CSS Grid course really helped me understand how to utizilite grid for this project with little prior knowledge. I highly recommend checking it out.
